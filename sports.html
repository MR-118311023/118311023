<div class="content">
<p style ="text-align:center;"> Since a very young age, I have been very interested in sports. My favourite sports are soccer and swimming:</p>
 
 <h3>Soccer</h3>

 <p> I played for my local schoolboy team, Villa F.C. from when I was 9 years old up until I was 17 years and I really enjoyed my time there. I played either central midfield or right wing. I loved training and playing matches and I made loads of friends who were on the team.</p>
 <p> I also love watching football. From a very young age, I have supported Arsenal. I absolutely love watching Arsenal play. I feel like they are connected to me. I am over the moon when they win and I feel dejected when they lose.</p>

 <h3>Swimming</h1>

 <p> I have always loved swimming. I competed in swimming races when I was younger and more recently, I completed a lifeguard course.</p>
 <p> I have always viewed Michael Phelps as a role model. In my opinion, he is the greatest swimmer of all time.</p>
